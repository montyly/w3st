## What is it?

The **Web3 Security Tools Seminar (W3ST)** is a focused gathering of developers and researchers who are **building security-focused tools** in the blockchain ecosystem.

No business pitches. No marketing. Just **deep technical exchange**.

---

## Goals

- **Share** challenges and insights from building tools (static analysis, fuzzers, formal verification, AI, etc.)  
- **Bridge** the security tooling community by exchanging ideas between teams, ecosystems, and open-source efforts  
- **Participate** by asking questions, sharing insights, and contributing to discussions. This is a collaborative event, not just a series of lectures.

## Call for Submissions (Closed)

We are looking for presentations that detail the technical aspects of tooling development. The target audience is fellow security tool experts, so we are seeking deeply technical submissions.

The following are examples of questions we would love to see discussed (not exhaustive):

- What EVM opcodes were the most challenging for your tool to support, and how did you overcome those challenges?
- What particular difficulties did you encounter when applying your Ethereum-based analysis to another chain?
- How do you balance speed with smart heuristics in your fuzzer?
- What strategies does your fuzzer use for its feedback loop?
- What lessons did you learn from using LLVM for EVM?
- What over- or under-approximation techniques did you use, and how did you decide between them?
- What heuristics do you follow to balance false positives and false negatives?
- How did you optimize your loop fixpoint to speed up your analysis?
- What prompt-engineering techniques were the most impactful in your LLM-based tool?
- How have LLMs improved your tools?

Submissions on proprietary or closed-source tools are welcome, provided they share meaningful technical details.
